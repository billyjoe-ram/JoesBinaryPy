# Joe's Binary Py

Are you looking for a simple way to know how to represent
a number, let's say "33", in binary? Or maybe you really
don't care about binaries, but your teacher of algorithms
gave you a list of exercises to convert from decimal to
various bases (2, 8, 16) but last night you were at a
party and totally forgot. Quoting Uncle Bob, in a set of
lectures about clean code he gave in 2019, "if a computer
can do it, a computer should do it"!

# Updates
- Oct. 11<sup>th</sup>: Added full support for Windows
by including and .exe file;

# How to run the executable?
This repository contains a simple code and an executable
of the program and its files were created using a Linux
environment (Ubuntu) and PyCharm.

**Windows:** Go to the file /dist/main.exe and run the
executable by clicking it twice.

**Linux:**
Open the folder mentioned in terminal and run the
file by typing "./main" (with no extension) 

# The script

To practice Python in a program that would interest 
**me**, I created this simple script that converts
positive integer numbers applying a method humans are
used to (remainders of a number divided by 2 and its
rest, inverted).

A recent feature now allows continuous running of the
script, and also visual representation of negative
numbers

# Testing
Open the folder in terminal, type "python test_main.py",
and you'll see a tiny spark of what the Test Driven
Development can do!

If you, as a developer, think of new possible test
cases, please consider following the recommended
steps mentioned in the Support section of this README.

# Ideas for updates
Version Beta 1.1:
- [X] Support for Windows;
- [X] Implement support for negative numbers;
- [X] Use TDD;

Version Beta 1.2:
- [ ] Handle alphanumerics;
- [ ] Implement support for decimal numbers;
- [ ] Simple math operations (Sum and Subtraction).
