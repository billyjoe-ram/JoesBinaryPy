# Joe's Binary Py

Are you looking for a simple way to know how to represent
a number, let's say "33", in binary? Or maybe you really
don't care about binaries, but your teacher of algorithms
gave you a list of exercises to convert from decimal to
various bases (2, 8, 16) but last night you were at a
party and totally forgot. Quoting Uncle Bob, in a set of
lectures about clean code he gave in 2019, "if a computer
can do it, a computer should do it"!

# Updates
- Oct. 11<sup>th</sup>: Added full support for Windows by
including and .exe file;

# How to run the executable?
This repository contains a simple code and an executable
of the program and its files were created using a Linux
environment (Ubuntu) and PyCharm.

**Windows:** Go to the file /dist/main.exe and run the
executable by clicking it twice.

Linux:
Open the folder mentioned in terminal and run the file by
typing "./main" (with no extension) 

# The script

To practice Python in a program that would interest 
**me**, I created this simple script that converts
positive integer numbers applying a method humans are
used to (remainders of a number divided by 2 and its
rest, inverted). There are a couple rules set by the
programmer (myself LOL):
- The program doesn't run more than 50 times, but this
can be changed in the code;
- The program stops if you pass a negative or decimal
number to it;

# Ideas for updates
- [x] Support for Windows
- [ ] Implement support for negative numbers;
